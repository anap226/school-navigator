Dear {{ school.name }} Team,

We are following up on an email you recently received from Lisa Gordon Stella to ask for your help. In partnership with the Durham Charter Collaborative and Durham Public Schools, we at Code for Durham (http://codefordurham.com) are creating a resource called School Navigator (http://durhamschoolnavigator.org) to support families in understanding the city's public school landscape. The website will help families identify their zoned schools, view all public schools relative to their location, and access detailed and consistent information about each school. 
 
In order to create a great profile for {{ school.name }}, we are requesting your help. We ask that you and your team complete the survey below by {{ school_profile.due_date }} so we can include your school's completed profile on the site. Please see below for the survey link and instructions. 
 
Email schoolnavigatorteam@gmail.com if you have any questions. We know you are very busy and greatly appreciate you making time to complete this survey. Many thanks in advance for your help in creating this resource for Durham's families! 
 
Sincerely,
School Navigator Team
 
Due Date: {{ school_profile.due_date }}
Survey Link: {{ school_profile_url }}
 
Survey Instructions
- You can complete the survey in multiple sittings and share the link with others. Just be sure to click SAVE at the bottom of the survey each time you work on it.
- You can view the saved information entered in the survey on your school's profile here: {{ school_profile_url }}. Only those with this link can view the profile right now.
- Please complete the survey by {{ school_profile.due_date }}. At this time, the survey will close and will no longer be accessible to you.
- We expect the survey to take 30-60 minutes to complete, depending on how easily accessible the information is to you.
 
Additional FYI
- You can view a completed sample profile here: https://durhamschoolnavigator.org/#/school/247/
- Moving forward, we will ask annually only for changes you want to make to the existing profile, so the survey will take much less time to complete in the future.
- There is some information such as school size and teacher satisfaction data that will appear in the profile but is not included in the survey because we will collect this information directly from DPI and DPS. The sample profile shows all the information that will appear in the final version of the profile.
- The next phase of the site will include sourcing testimonials from Durham parents. This section is currently empty on the profiles.
